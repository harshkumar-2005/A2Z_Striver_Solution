**Naive solution**:-

=> We divide the array from middle use first half as Stack1 and another half as Stack2.

=>Inefficient use of space.
If we add 5 items to the Stack1, & no item in Stack2, then we cannot add more items to Stack1 even if we have space in the array.

**Efficient solution**:-

┌────────────────────────┐
│->                    <-│
└────────────────────────┘

=> Begin Both stack from the two corners of the array.

=> Now we can insert items in any stack as long as we have some space.
